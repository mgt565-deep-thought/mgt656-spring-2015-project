<h3>Status Report</h3>
<p>Team Deep Thought holds sprint meeting every Wednesday from 4-5pm at the Center for Engineering, Innovation, and Design. From our last meeting we created an iterated system for judging story value; this is based off of cost of delay and sizing. This list of stories and their values is kept in a rudimentary manner on a Google doc. Judging value for each became too cumbersome/too detailed, so we decided to agree on the few that seemed most important, and then to assign values to those. The stories we had comp chosen to complete are in order to create the minimum viable product-- namely that the website has events listed on the home page, event details exist, and and that the event form existed. </p>
	<p>We were able to complete these faster than expected, thanks to the help of instructional videos. This necessitated our team to take on more stories. Due to our lack of values for all of the stories and our inability to communicate (with depth) before the next sprint meeting, team members just completed stories that were interesting to them, using Waffle to track progress.  In this way, more stories than anticipated were completed. Teammates merging each other’s work via Github helped assure that quality was checked by multiple team members. This unanticipated level of work accomplished will give Deep Thought the ability to better predict team velocity and assign relative values to as yet uncompleted stories.</p>
	<p>Less importantly, there seems to be an issue with stories being double listed in Waffle. We create them manually, but Github also adds them in the completed column every time a branch has been merged. This can be discussed in the next sprint meeting.</p>
